The question:

Imagine there is text box you have to fill with random characters using your keyboard. The goal is to fill it in as little time as possible, without pasting any external text. Here are some obvious conclusions:
- Firstly I can just smash random letters on the keyboard, but it costs me time since I have to navigate between keys with my fingers.
- I can therefore assume its fastest to keep a key pressed and let the text box fill with a singular character. 
- This works for a small text box, but for a larger text box, I will prefer to copy paste the characters I just typed, since that is allowed.

So now the questions arising are
- What is the fastest time I can achieve for a given length of text box?
- At what length is it most efficient to stop typing the letter and starting to copy and paste the letters that I have?
- Can I derive an equation that taking the length of the text box as input, give me the exact steps to follow?

Let us look into it:
